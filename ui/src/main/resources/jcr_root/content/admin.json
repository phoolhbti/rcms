Before then, single-page newspapers, called broadsides, were published in the English colonies and printed in Cambridge in 1689. The first edition was published September 25, 1690, in Boston, Massachusetts, and was intended to be published monthly, &quot;or, if any Glut of Occurrences happen, oftener.&quot; It was printed by American Richard Pierce of Boston, and it was edited by Benjamin Harris, who had previously published a newspaper in London. The paper contained four six by ten inch pages, and filled only three of them. No second edition was printed, as the paper was shut down by the British colonial authorities on Sept. 29th, 1690.</p>"
